Old MFC C++ Windows App demo featuring class wrapper to retrieve win32 module information (VS_VERSION_INFO resource) 

Environment:Win 95, Win 98 SE, NT4 SP3, Win 2000

Yet another class to get all the VS_VERSION_INFO resource information you need, from any module!

Many people have requested this code in response to reading some of my posts - well, here it is. You can optionally specify
language id and code page, to query language specific VS_VERSION_INFO elements of the block - very helpful. You have the option
of querying your own module information (many people have been confused as to how to do this). The code to get your own module name,
I have included in a separate class (CVFXGetModuleName) so that you can use it separately (for whatever reason). The retrieved values, 
are also returned in a separate class (CVFXVersionRes) making it easy to pass the retrieved information around as an object.

Feel free to improve upon it if you find it lacking in any area - enjoy!
